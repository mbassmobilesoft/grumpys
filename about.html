                    I’m Leah with Grumpy’s bail bonds and people often ask 
                    “where are you from and how did you get involved in the 
                    bail bond business?” I was born in Beech Grove and was 
                    raised on a farm. I paid for college through ROTC, 
                    served my country in the United States Army and then 
                    traded my combat boots for high heeled shoes. I won my 
                    title as Miss Tennessee, competed in Miss America, and 
                    then the Miss USA pageant. Through life’s experiences, 
                    here I am back home serving 
                    the people of Middle Tennessee. Thank you Tennessee 
                    for voting Grumpy’s Bail Bonds as the number one bail 
                    bonding business in Middle Tennessee. We sincerely 
                    appreciate that you valued our efforts in getting 
                    you out of jail the fastest and in helping you get 
                    your life back on track. We believe in reuniting 
                    families, and we believe in you. When you ring, 
                    we spring!

        <h3 class="abouth3" style="font-size: 50px;">We believe in your right to be bailed out of jail.</h3>
            <p>
                It’s a meaningful right to have, especially if you are 
                innocent, which costs the tax payers absolutely nothing. 
                In fact, allowing people to get out of jail on bail 
                SAVES the tax payers millions of dollars each year. 
                However, even if you are not innocent of a charge 
                levied against you, the right to bail allows you your 
                freedom while you mount a good defense and get your 
                affairs in order pending any punishment for the crime 
                for which you are accused.
            </p>
        <h3 class="abouth3" style="font-size: 50px;">We believe in our justice system and in our local government.</h3>
            <p>
                We place our confidence in our elected officials and feel that 
                it is our duty and responsibility to be politically involved in the process. 
                Communication within the system makes a difference, and votes matter!
            </p>
        <h3 class="abouth3" style="font-size: 50px;">We believe in and support our law enforcement.</h3>
            <p>We are thankful for and respect the difficult job that law enforcement 
                does every day in preserving our communities in middle TN, in 
                protecting our children, and in keeping us safe. When the bail 
                industry and law enforcement work together, the community and 
                its people benefit.
            </p>
        <h3 class="abouth3" style="font-size: 50px;">We Believe…</h3>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in the right to bail!</span>
            <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in Tennessee, its people 
                and its businesses that we serve daily 
                by providing the fastest, friendliest, 
                and most affordable professional bail b

                <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in and support all law enforcement 
                and are thankful for and respect the difficult 
                job they do every day in preserving the peace 
                and protecting all Tennesseans.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in justice, and we are confident 
                in and support the state’s judicial system 
                and process.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in our community and our local and 
                state government, and feel it is our duty and 
                responsibility to be politically and civically 
                involved.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">We believe in helping those in need by addressing 
                real problems and by serving as a “tool” of 
                accountability with love and compassion and 
                firmness.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p style="font-size: 40px;"><strong>We don’t believe…</strong>that everyone should be bailed out of jail.</p>
