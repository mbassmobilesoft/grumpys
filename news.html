            <h2>Leah Hulan of Grumpy’s Bail Bonds: FACES of Nashville</h2>
            <h4 class="newsSubHead">An interview with Liza Graves:</h4>
            <br></br>

                Walking into Leah Hulan’s Grumpy’s Bail 
                Bonds office in downtown Nashville is 
                more akin to walking into someone’s 
                home than into an office, much less an 
                office that centers around bailing people 
                out of jail. The office is in an historic 
                building near Second Avenue and Union 
                Street. It has bedrooms for when agents 
                need to be on call, a large TV room, a 
                personal gym, a bar and office areas. 
                The walls feature bold colors, including 
                red, purple and green.
                <br></br>
                Leah was running late the morning of our 
                interview and apologized, saying she almost 
                cancelled the interview as it’s been a tough 
                time. She and her husband of 20 years are 
                divorcing, and they are about a month 
                into this decision. She also is the owner of 
                Arcadian Wrestling Association, which she 
                launched in January. So, now she’s running 
                two businesses and raising her 10-year-old daughter.

            <h2>Leah “The Bond Girl” Made the news!</h2>
            <h4 class="newsSubHead">Here’s an excerpt from the article by Karen Parr-Moody:</h4>
            <br></br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">
                <img src="grumpys_bus-1.png" alt="GrumpysNews" style="width:220px;height:200px; margin-right: 25px; float: left">
                When Leah Hulan, the blonde and sexy 
                “Bond Girl” and owner of Grumpy’s Bail 
                Bonding LLC, calls to chat with ClarksvilleNow, the 
                interview gets cut short due to a bail bond “jumper.” 
                This jumper, she says, is out on a substantial 
                bond and is hiding in a Hickman County trailer,
                she informs me in her singsong Southern accent. 
                So she needs to get back to working with a SWAT 
                team to catch this criminal.
                <br></br>
                “People run on all types of things – big things, 
                little things,” she says later, when we continue 
                the interview. “But this one was a rather large thing. 
                Fugitive recovery is a whole part of our business 
                that is stressful.”
                <br></br>
                Bail bonding can be dramatic. Hulan talks for a 
                few minutes about the more crime-addled counties of 
                Tennessee, where a jumper might be found in a meth 
                lab surrounded by 10 pit bulls.
                <br></br>
                But anyone who has seen Hulan’s glamorous photos 
                would think she’s on her way to a fundraiser or a 
                Faith Hill concert, not working with SWAT teams. 
                Those glamour shots are familiar to many Clarksvillians, 
                who see the former beauty queen splashed across the 
                bright pink bus that rolls around town advertising Grumpy’s.

            <h2>Grumpy’s ‘Bond Girl’ Overcomes Bingeing And Purging</h2>
            <h4 class="newsSubHead">An article by Brad Schmitt at The Tennessean:</h4>
            <br></br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px; font-family: sans-serif;">
                <img src="grumpy_news-1.png" alt="GrumpysNews" style="width:220px;height:200px; margin-right: 25px; float: left">
                Leah Hulan and her stepfather fought all the 
                time, and once in a great while, Hulan won. 
                Like the time she stared down her rabbit 
                stew all night long.
                <br></br>
                Hulan grew up on a farm and fell in love with 
                the animals her family raised, especially those 
                calves she named and bottle fed from birth.
                Her stepfather, with no explanation for his 
                stepchildren, would slaughter those animals for 
                food — and he ordered the kids to do the same, 
                Hulan said."That was difficult for me," she 
                said, voice catching. "We would be forced to 
                kill them and cut them up. I felt like I 
                needed a little more sensitivity." 
                <br></br>
                Things came to a 
                head one night when she was 8 years old. Dinner 
                was rabbit stew, made from little furry bunnies 
                Hulan considered pets the day before. She refused to 
                eat the stew.  "You're gonna sit here until you eat 
                your dinner," her stepfather insisted, Hulan recalled.
